  <h2>1. The Field and Ball</h2>
  <p>The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch. The ball is spherical and can be made of various materials. A standard pitch is between 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. A goal is scored when the entire ball crosses the opponent's goal line.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>2. Players and Positions</h2>
  <p>A standard football team has 11 players on the field at a time: 1 goalkeeper, 4 defenders, 4 midfielders, and 2 forwards. Substitutions can be made during the game under specific rules.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>3. Scoring and Gameplay</h2>
  <p>The objective is to score a goal by getting the ball over the opponent's goal line. The ball is advanced by kicking, dribbling, and passing. The clock runs for two halves of 45 minutes each, plus any injury time.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>4. Fouls and Penalties</h2>
  <p>Fouls are infractions of the rules. Common fouls include tripping, pushing, and handball. The referee can issue a yellow card(caution) or a red card(ejection) for more serious fouls. A red card results in the player being sent off.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>5. The Offside Rule</h2>
  <p>A player is in an offside position if they are closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent when the ball is played to them. An offside foul is called if that player becomes involved in the play.</p>
